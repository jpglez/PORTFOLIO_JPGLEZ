# Juan Pablo González Sanmiguel – Personal Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio where I showcase some of the projects I've built, including:

- Little Lemon Restaurant Website (Meta Front-End Developer Program)
- Quote Generator (JavaScript-based)
- Other web development and front-end practice projects

The main purpose of this portfolio is to present my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as my progress as I continue learning and building more real-world projects.

The site is fully responsive and built to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate. It includes live demos, GitHub links, and brief descriptions of each project.
